# FirstWebsite
This project was for my web applications development class where we had to create a website with basic functionality and a shopping cart.

Firstly, The project has been split into HTML, JavaScipt and CSS files. This allows for easier implementation and keep all differnt coding languages separate but still able to work with eachother effectively. 

The ProjectWebsite.HTML file works as the basis of the project. This includes the references to the CSS and Javascript pages so that they can effect the overall HTML.

The Actual HTML document is used to create the page itself. Within this page is the following:
A banner is created and set up to go across the top of the page including Images, and various tabs that can be clicked including the log in and the shopping cart. For the full functionality of the page to work first you must log in using admin/pass and then you can use the shopping cart from there. functionality for login and shopping cart are also set up in this page using buttons and modals. this is done using Classes and IDs which are influenced by javascript and CSS for design functionality.

A slideslow is created with various images used within the website in a similar way to the above modals, pulling the images from a specific folder in the directory. 

Finally there is a list of various products that are set up on the page via a list to create 2 rows of images that allow for integration with the shopping cart.

The index.js file contails the following:
variables required to make and build the modals, buttons and shopping carts work correctly.
javascript to allow onclick functions to work.
fucntionality to close modals.
Creating the login fucntion including login lines, textboxes and preset password. Also including a confirmation line for the login validation. 
The functionality to add items to the created shopping cart via a list and creating new elements also totaling the values at the end of the cart.
functionality for the slideshow and how they work.

The CSS file contains all of the customisation factors for the various modals, buttons ect. This file basically forms the backgrounds/images/sizes padding ect for all of the various elements contained in the website.

There is room for additional functionality to a database which can be included further based on the various list elements. (purchasable items).

the databases test file can be used as a basis to set up a database and link it with the website as required. - further work would be required.
